# NCM-Forest-FPGA
An FPGA implementation of the NCM-Forest algorithm, using the myhdl python package.

## What's in this repo? 
Under the `doc/` folder, you'll find documentation for the different modules (TODO).  
Under the `modules/` folder, you'll find all the HDL modules. Their test benches are in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks.
**DISCLAIMER**, you will only find functionning modules on here, the ones needing debugging are handled in another private and local repository.

## Dependencies
So far, only one dependency is needed `myhdl 0.11` for python 3.
Code is tested under the `default` branch of python `3.8.2`.
